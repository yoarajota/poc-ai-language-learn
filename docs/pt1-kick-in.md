# Speech Pronunciation Correction System Roadmap

This notebook outlines a step-by-step roadmap for building a system that corrects pronunciations. The key steps in the process are:

1. **Stream speech to text in phrases**
2. **Send text to LLM to fix phrases**
3. **Transform both texts in G2P responses**
4. **Compare if the G2P responses are correct**
5. **If incorrect, use TTS to help fix the pronunciation**

Below you will find the detailed plan for each step along with references for further exploration.
## Step 1: Stream Speech to Text in Phrases

**Objective:**
- Capture live audio and segment it into meaningful phrases using a Speech-to-Text system.

**Actions:**
- Use real-time audio processing libraries (e.g., `pyaudio` or `sounddevice`).
- Integrate Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to mark the boundaries of phrases.
- Stream and transcribe each phrase individually.
## Step 2: Send Text to LLM to Fix Phrases

**Objective:**
- Process the transcribed phrases with a Large Language Model (LLM) to refine and correct any errors.

**Actions:**
- Send each transcribed phrase to an LLM via an API or integrated model.
- Craft prompts that specifically target pronunciation or phrasing issues.
- Receive and store the corrected version of the text.
## Step 3: Transform Both Texts into G2P Responses

**Objective:**
- Convert both the original and corrected texts into phonetic representations using a G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme) model.

**Actions:**
- Utilize a G2P tool (e.g., NVIDIA NeMo Toolkit G2P or the CiscoDevNet g2p_seq2seq_pytorch example) to transform text into phoneme sequences.
- Obtain phonetic transcriptions for both the original and the LLM-corrected texts.
## Step 4: Compare G2P Responses

**Objective:**
- Compare the phonetic representations to determine if the correction has addressed the pronunciation issues.

**Actions:**
- Implement an algorithm to compare the two phoneme sequences (e.g., using edit distance or a similarity metric).
- Identify discrepancies that indicate pronunciation errors have not been fully corrected.
## Step 5: Use TTS to Help Fix the Pronunciation

**Objective:**
- Provide auditory feedback if the phonetic comparison reveals remaining issues.

**Actions:**
- Use a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine (e.g., NVIDIA NeMo TTS or another high-quality TTS service) to generate speech from the corrected text.
- Play the synthesized audio to the user so they can hear the corrected pronunciation.
- Optionally, prompt the user to repeat the phrase and re-run the pipeline for further refinement.

### CONCLUTION TEST USING GRAMMAR CORRECTION
Using g2p conversion followed by grammar correction doesn't feel quite right. This approach can produce sentences that lack proper meaning, which grammar correction alone may not be able to resolve.

I must use other workflow.
