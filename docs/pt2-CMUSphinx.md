# Speech Pronunciation Correction System using PocketSphinx!

Why CMUSphinx?

Sphinx is a continuous-speech, speaker-independent recognition system making use of hidden Markov acoustic models (HMMs) and an n-gram statistical language model. It was developed by Kai-Fu Lee. Sphinx featured feasibility of continuous-speech, speaker-independent large-vocabulary recognition, the possibility of which was in dispute at the time (1986).

## Example steps we can try:
- Transcribe Speech: Use ASR to convert spoken words into text.
- Align and Compare: Align the audio with the expected phonetic sequence to detect errors, like substituting “th” with “s” in “think.”
- Provide Feedback: Use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to play the correct pronunciation and highlight mistakes in the UI, allowing users to practice and improve.
